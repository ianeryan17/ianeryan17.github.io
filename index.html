    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and have worked on projects involving frontend development (React, TypeScript), backend infrastructure, and even game development with Unity and C#. I enjoy learning new technologies, working in collaborative environments, and building products that engage users meaningfully.</p>

    <p>Outside of programming, Iâ€™m interested in gaming, music, and creative problem solving. Iâ€™m currently looking for roles where I can contribute to impactful teams and continue growing as a developer.</p>
